Customer Feedback Analysis

This project analyzes customer feedback for an online retail store using a dataset containing feedback details such as customer IDs, feedback dates, product IDs, ratings, and customer comments. The goal is to clean the dataset, process the text data, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights related to customer feedback.

Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

Data Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and display its structure.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct data types, remove duplicates, and process the Comments column for text analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize rating distributions, explore frequent words in comments, and analyze rating trends over time.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Customer_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Feedback_Date: The date when the feedback was provided.
Product_ID: Identifier for the product.
Rating: Rating provided by the customer (1-5 scale).
Comments: Customer's feedback in text format.
Data Cleaning Steps
Handling Missing Values: Identified and dealt with missing data.
Correcting Data Types:
Converted Feedback_Date to datetime format.
Ensured Rating is numeric.
Processed Comments as text.
Text Processing:
Removed extra whitespace, converted text to lowercase, removed punctuation, and removed stopwords.
Tokenized the text for further analysis.
Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed any duplicate records in the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key Visualizations:
Rating Distribution: A histogram displaying the distribution of ratings.
Frequent Words: An analysis of the most common words appearing in customer feedback comments.
Trend Analysis: A time series graph visualizing rating trends over time.
Results:
Average Rating: The overall average rating across all feedback.
Most Common Words: Insights into the recurring themes in customer feedback.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
NLTK: For text processing and tokenization.
